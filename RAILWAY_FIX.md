# 🔧 Railway Deployment Fix

## Issue: "Cannot GET" Error

The "Cannot GET" error occurs because Railway wasn't serving the built frontend files properly.

## ✅ Fixed Changes:

1. **Updated `server/index.js`**:
   - Added static file serving for the `dist` directory
   - Added catch-all route to serve `index.html`
   - Fixed path resolution for ES modules

2. **Updated `package.json`**:
   - Added `postinstall` script to build frontend during deployment

3. **Added `nixpacks.toml`**:
   - Explicit build configuration for Railway

4. **Updated `railway.json`**:
   - Added production environment variable

## 🚀 Redeploy Steps:

### Option 1: Automatic Redeploy (Recommended)
1. **Push the changes to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
2. **Railway will automatically redeploy** with the new code
3. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for the build to complete
4. **Check your Railway URL** - it should work now!

### Option 2: Manual Redeploy
1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Click "Deploy" to trigger a new deployment

## 🧪 Test After Redeploy:

1. **Visit your Railway URL** (e.g., `https://your-app-name.railway.app`)
2. **You should see the meeting app homepage**
3. **Create a meeting** to test functionality
4. **Share the meeting link** with others

## 🔍 If Still Not Working:

### Check Railway Logs:
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Click on the latest deployment
5. Check the logs for any errors

### Common Issues:
- **Build failed**: Check if all dependencies are installed
- **Port issues**: Railway sets `PORT` environment variable automatically
- **File not found**: Ensure `dist` directory is created during build

### Manual Build Test:
You can test the build locally:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

## 📱 Expected Behavior:

After the fix, your Railway URL should:
- ✅ Show the meeting app homepage
- ✅ Allow creating meetings
- ✅ Generate shareable links
- ✅ Support real-time features
- ✅ Work on mobile devices

**The fix ensures that:**
- Frontend is built during deployment
- Static files are served correctly
- All routes work properly
- API endpoints remain accessible
